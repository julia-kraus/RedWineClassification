# WhiteWineClassification Challenge 
In this Github repository you find `winequality-white.csv`. This dataset has 11 features which are the results of chemical tests on  wine samples. The target variable is the wine quality, which is an integer between 0 (very bad) and 10 (excellent). You can find the description of the dataset in `wineQualityInfo.txt`.

## Task
Your task consists of the following steps:
* Data Exploration
* Feature Selection
* Train one Clustering __or__ Regression __or__ Classification model of your choice (if you choose regression or classification, split the data into training and test set)
* Interpret the results and explain your workflow

This task should take you about 4-6 hours. The goal is first and foremost not having a perfect model score, but presenting and explaining a consistent workflow. 

### Data Exploration
Preliminary analysis of the dataset for a better 

### Feature Selection
The dataset has 11 features. This might be too much, regarding the small dataset. Reduce the number of features/dimensionality of the dataset while losing as little information as possible.

### Model Training
Train one machine learning model. You can choose between a clustering, classification or regression algorithm. 

### Results
Present, interpret and explain the results of your data analysis.

## Jupyter Notebook
You are free in your choice of programming language/toolkit. We recommend using the Jupyter notebook we already started for you: `WhiteWineAnalysis.ipynb`. Even if you use another IDE, take a quick look at the notebook, as there could be useful information inside.

## Questions
If there are any questions left, feel free to contact me under julia.kraus@rohde-schwarz.com.

Have fun with the data! Looking forward to seeing you again.
